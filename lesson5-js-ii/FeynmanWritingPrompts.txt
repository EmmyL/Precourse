	* `for` - The for loop enables most software systems to run code and execute core functions of the program. It consists of three statements within                     parentheses. The first statement assigns a value to the variable; the second assigns a condition; and the third statement runs if the 
                  second condition is met. Additionally, if the third statement runs, the loop begins again. The letter 'i' is most popularly used as the 
                  variable. This is an example of the for loop structure and syntax:
			
			for (i=0; i<=100; i++;) {
			console.log (i);
			}

		
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` 

		&& represents "and" in Javascript, which allows two conditions to be stated, compared, and if BOTH conditions are either true or false, 
		the program will return what is asked. Here is an example:
			
			if (10 < 4 && 20 === 20); {
			return true; } 					//returns true because both statements are true

		|| stands for "or" in Javascript, which compares two conditions, and if one of the conditions is true or false, the program will return what 		is asked. Here is an example:
		
			if (10 > 30 || 2.34 > 2.33); {
			return true;					//return true because one of the statements is true

		! is the symbol for "not" in Javascript, which flips any boolean to its opposite. "!True" becomes false, and "!False" becomes true. 

			if (!(10 < 4 && 20 === 20)); {
			return true; }					//Will not return undefined (next line of code will not run), because the if 										statement has been turned false
